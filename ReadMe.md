  ## description:
   This application was created to generate a back-end application for an e-commerce site that uses the command line interface (CLI) and object-relational mapping for various methods of data manipulation, storage, and retrieval when using HTTP methods with a RESTUL API.

  ## installation:
   User should clone down the repo from github and download Node. The application also requires MySQL2, Sequelize, express, and dotenv.
   
  ## usage:
   Open the command line and use inquirer to answer prompts about your team.
